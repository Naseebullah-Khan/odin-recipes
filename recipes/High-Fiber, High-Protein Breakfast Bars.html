<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  I came up with this recipe when my doctor told me I needed to eat more fiber,
  and I was sick of eating store-bought protein bars for breakfast in the car
  between the gym and work. Ingredients such as wheat germ, flaxseed, protein
  powder, peanut butter, and oats make this a healthy way to start the day!
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>cooking spray</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups quick-cooking oats</li>
  <li>¼ cup wheat germ</li>
  <li>¼ cup ground flax seed</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons vanilla-flavored hemp protein powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>3 bananas</li>
  <li>¼ cup peanut butter (such as Jif®)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>¼ cup natural peanut butter, or to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch baking dish
    with aluminum foil, letting foil hang down over the sides of the pan; spray
    pan with cooking spray.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir oats, wheat germ, flax seed, protein powder, cinnamon, and salt
    together in a bowl. Mash bananas in a separate large bowl and stir 1/4 cup
    Jif® peanut butter, honey, and vanilla extract into bananas, mixing well.
    Stir dry ingredients into banana mixture and spread into the prepared baking
    dish.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Spread 1/4 cup natural peanut
    butter over top.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue baking until lightly browned on the edges and set, 10 more minutes.
    Let cool in the pan and lift bars onto a work surface using aluminum foil as
    handles. Cut into bars, wrap in plastic wrap, and store in refrigerator.
  </li>
</ol>
